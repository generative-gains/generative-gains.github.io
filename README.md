# Generative Gains — Minimal Website (Light + Gold)

A clean, minimal, single‑page website themed from the provided logo.

## Files

- `index.html` — markup and content
- `styles.css` — minimalist light theme with refined gold accents
- `script.js` — smooth scrolling, mobile menu, and subtle fade‑in
- `assets/logo.png` — logo file (place the provided image here)

## Setup

1. Create a folder named `assets` next to `index.html`.
2. Save the provided logo image as `assets/logo.png` (PNG recommended, 500×500 works fine).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
	- Optional: serve locally for nicer caching and routing.

## Customization

- Update the email link in the Contact section inside `index.html`.
- Adjust colors and spacing via CSS variables in `styles.css`.
- To add a favicon, copy `assets/logo.png` to `favicon.png` and update the `<link rel="icon">` in the `<head>`.

### Social icons

- Inline SVGs are used for Email, LinkedIn, X, and GitHub. Update the `href` values in the footer inside `index.html`.

### Frameworks

- No frameworks required. Pure HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity (Bootstrap removed).

### Placeholders
- Three placeholder images live in `assets/placeholder-*.svg`. Replace them with your own visuals anytime.

## Notes

- The design keeps a generous amount of whitespace, thin typography, and a restrained gold accent to match the mark.
- All interactions are client‑side and dependency‑free.
